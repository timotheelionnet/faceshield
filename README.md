3D printing models for faceshields built at NYU for NYU Langone Health
These models are based on the budmen design  https://budmen.com/ with modifications 
for comfort and durability based on NYU Langone Health ICU and Emergency Medicine staff.
Design by Mihály Vöröslakos, Neta Agmon and Timothee Lionnet based on the budmen model.

Assembly requires:
- 1 3D printed shield holder (shield_holder_nyu)
- 1 3D printed strap lock (strap-lock)
- 1 transparent shield (we have used 0.5 mm thick carbonate sheets, cut pattern in transparent_shield_cut_nyu)
- 1 elastic band (0.5" wide)
- 1 piece of foam (3/4" wide by 0.5" thick weather stripping foam; about 9" per shield)
- 4 pop rivets (1/8" diameter, 1/8" grip length)

Instructions:
- 3D print the shield holder and its strap lock. 0.3 mm thick layers, 10% infill with 2 solid layers at the top and bottom work well for us. Using a 0.8 mm nozzle reduces print time more than 2-fold compared to 0.4 mm.
- cut the carbonate sheet (following the pattern in transparent_shield_cut_nyu). We have used laser cutting and other tools.
- cut a 9" long foam strip and stick it to the inside part of the shield holder.
- using a riveter, secure foam to shield holder with four pop rivets.
- cut desired length of elastic band and tighten using the strap lock.
- wipe assembly with Isopropyl Rubbing Alcohol 70% Wipe.
