# faceshield

3D printing models for faceshields built at NYU for NYU Langone Health
These models are based on the budmen design  https://budmen.com/ with modifications 
for comfort and durability based on NYU Langone Health ICU and Emergency Medicine staff.

Assembly requires:
- 1 3D printed shield holder (shield_holder_nyu)
- 1 3D printed strap lock (strap-lock)
- 1 transparent shield (we have used 0.5 mm thick carbonate sheets, cut pattern in transparent_shield_cut_nyu)
- 1 elastic band (0.5" wide)
- 1 piece of foam (3/4" wide by 0.5" thick weather stripping foam; about 9" per shield)
- 4 pop rivets (1/8" diameter, 1/8" grip length)
